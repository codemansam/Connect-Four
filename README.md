# Connect-four

The final project for the Intro to Java Programming course at udacity.com.  This project entailed programming a player agent (MyAgent) to play against agents supplied by the course creators.  Agent Sam reliably beats all of the provided agents including a greater than 70% win rate versus the Brilliant Agent.
